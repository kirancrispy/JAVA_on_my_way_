Anatomy of Class

public class MyDeavisitores {
public static void main (String[] args) {
System.out.println("i rule");

public is for everyone can access it 
class is  the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have
MyDeavisitores its a name of class
{ curly brace are oppening means class are opened
static i ll explain in later
void the return type void means ther is no return value's main means name of this methods
(String[] args) arguments to the method this method must be given an array of strings ,and the array will be called args.
{ oppening the braces for methods
System.out.print this says print the standard output 
("i rule") the string you want to print 
; every statement must be end in a semicolon
} closing brace of the main  method
} closing brace of class
